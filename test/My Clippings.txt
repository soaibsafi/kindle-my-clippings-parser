I used to stop a t waterfalls and such romantic places. I t was as though the Hills had a special language for me, to which I had to listen. When teachers or the other boys scolded or laughed at me, I held my tongue. If they couldn't hear the voices I heard, how could they be expected to understand me ?

“That people’s memories are maybe the fuel they burn to stay alive. Whether those memories have any actual importance or not, it doesn’t matter as far as the maintenance of life is concerned. They’re all just fuel. Advertising fillers in the newspaper, philosophy books, dirty pictures in a magazine, a bundle of ten-thousand-yen bills: when you feed ’em to the fire, they’re all just paper. The fire isn’t thinking, ‘Oh, this is Kant,’ or ‘Oh, this is the Yomiuri evening edition,’ or ‘Nice tits,’ while it burns. To the fire, they’re nothing but scraps of paper. It’s the exact same thing. Important memories, not-so-important memories, totally useless memories: there’s no distinction—they’re all just fuel.”

this pain, as much as we hate it, is useful. Pain is what teaches us what to pay attention to when we’re young or careless. It helps show us what’s good for us versus what’s bad for us. It helps us understand and adhere to our own limitations.

And like our physical pain, our psychological pain is not necessarily always bad or even undesirable. In some cases, experiencing emotional or psychological pain can be healthy or necessary. Just like stubbing our toe teaches us to walk into fewer tables, the emotional pain of rejection or failure teaches us how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

বুদ্ধদেব বললেন, নির্বাণলাভের জন্য চেষ্টা করো। তা হলেই এই পৃথিবীর সব কষ্টের অবসান হবে। নির্বাণ কী? আমরা জানি, নির্বাণমানে নিভে যাওয়া। তবে কি আত্মার বিনাশের কথা, মৃত্যুর কথা বলছেন বুদ্ধদেব? না। বৌদ্ধধর্ম বলছে, তৃষ্ণাই নানারকম জন্মের কারণ। তুমি যদি মুক্ত হতে চাও, তবে এই তৃষ্ণাকে ধ্বংস করো। তৃষ্ণা ইত্যাদি কারণের ক্ষয় হলে তোমার দুঃখেরও ক্ষয় হবে। ধর্মের দিকে দৃষ্টি দাও। তা হলে তৃষ্ণা দূর হবে। ধর্মে জন্ম নেই, জরা মৃত্যু নেই, ব্যধি নেই, নৈরাশ্য নেই। ধর্মই পাওয়ার মতাে জিনিস।

there is no measurable correlation between a high IQ and academic success – at least not north of 120. Yes, a certain intellectual capacity helps to get into academia, and if you struggle severely with an IQ test, it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems, too. But once you are in, a superior IQ will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure.

You may remember from school the difference between an exergonic and an endergonic reaction. In the first case, you constantly need to add energy to keep the process going. In the second case, the reaction, once triggered, continues by itself and even releases energy. The dynamics of work are not so different. Sometimes we feel like our work is draining our energy and we can only move forward if we put more and more energy into it. But sometimes it is the opposite. Once we get into the workflow, it is as if the work itself gains momentum, pulling us along and sometimes even energizing us.

Attention is not our only limited resource. Our short-term memory is also limited. We need strategies not to waste its capacity with thoughts we can better delegate to an external system. While the estimations of our long-term memory capacity are wildly diverse and rather speculative, psychologists used to tend to agree on a very specific number when it came to short-term memory: We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two (Miller 1956).
