## ÔªøNanga Parbat Pilgrimage by Buhl s  
- I used to stop a t waterfalls and such romantic places. I t was as though the Hills had a special language for me, to which I had to listen. When teachers or the other boys scolded or laughed at me, I held my tongue. If they couldn't hear the voices I heard, how could they be expected to understand me ?

- Ou r heavy task for the day was the "Riepen Gully", the hardest climb in the Kalkkijgel.
- I HAD by now a good many Severes and Super-Severes behind me, and still I felt like a beginner. Not just because I was only eighteen years old; it was as though I were under orders, working under some inner law, which commanded me t o get better, tougher: "You are under the spell of the Hills, but you must make yourself worthy of them, too."
- h e South-East Wall of t h e Schiisselkarspitze
- remain a visible memento of the Sudost to this day. He dealt with the situation with some clips, a tonsure and a head-bandage. By midnight I had rejoined my partner. We had a short sleep, then we set out again by the same path as yesterday. T h i s time our aim was the South Face "direct". I t was only a few years since Kuno Rainer and Paul, Peter Aschenbrenner's brother, made the first ascent, and after several attempts had failed
- visited the Schiisselkarspitxe in the We t t e r s t e in Range again and again. Everything a climber can ask for is to be found on i t s South Face.
- h e Schusselkarspitze East Wall-our goal this time-seemed t o be literally washed away under the descending deluge
- climbers have t o be self-reliant, headstrong blockheads or they would come t o grief every time the mountains demand initiative or power of decision of them
- My fingers were bleeding, though I hadn't noticed it till I saw the red blotches on the rock.

- I had realised tha t you have to use the same methods as on rock. Ice also
- First, Mummery, that great English climber, one of the outstanding climbers of his day. H e failed t o recognise the overwhelming size of the mountain and attacked it by a face from which an experienced, Hima- laya-wise party turned away appalled forty-four years later. I t was in 1895 tha t Mummery laid the foundation-stone of the pyramid which grew t o be the history of Nanga Parbat. H e is the first of the men to whom I feel moved t o report and to render my reckoning; I want him t o know that I climbed Nanga Parbat without the assistance of any modern climbing aids, tha t is to say, in the way he would have wanted it, under my own steam, by what he himself considered "fair means". T h e second
- porters. Forgotten were the Inany occasions when we had to scold them; I still remember them as they were that day at Gilgit, when they ran after the jeep in which Walter Frauenberger-"the kind SahibH--and T were seated, as they waved to us, wished us luck and said good-bye with tears in their eyes. None of us would ever forget them.
- we have been u p here for weeks and can't bear to think it has been in vain. We are going u p to Camp I V to-morrow and then to Camp V, close under the Silbersattel, from where we will set out on our summit bid. I hope i t will come off this time; it will not be my fault if it doesn't! And I can tell you this-if we d o get to the top, then it will have been entirely to our own credit. . . . , , T h a t evening in the kitchen-tent was a historic one!
## Nanga Parbat (Herrligkoffer,Karl M.)

- I‚Äôm free, I think. I shut my eyes and think hard and deep about how free I am, but I can‚Äôt really understand what it means. All I know is I‚Äôm totally alone. All alone in an unfamiliar place, like some solitary explorer who‚Äôs lost his compass and his map. Is this what it means to be free? I don‚Äôt know, and I give up thinking about it.

There‚Äôs no direction where I am, no sky, no ground.

The fire isn‚Äôt thinking, ‚ÄòOh, this is Kant,‚Äô or ‚ÄòOh, this is the Yomiuri evening edition,‚Äô or ‚ÄòNice tits,‚Äô while it burns. To the fire, they‚Äôre nothing but scraps of paper.

- this pain, as much as we hate it, is useful. Pain is what teaches us what to pay attention to when we‚Äôre young or careless. It helps show us what‚Äôs good for us versus what‚Äôs bad for us. It helps us understand and adhere to our own limitations.
- And like our physical pain, our psychological pain is not necessarily always bad or even undesirable. In some cases, experiencing emotional or psychological pain can be healthy or necessary. Just like stubbing our toe teaches us to walk into fewer tables, the emotional pain of rejection or failure teaches us how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

## How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking ‚Äì for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers (S√∂nke Ahrens)
- there is no measurable correlation between a high IQ and academic success ‚Äì at least not north of 120. Yes, a certain intellectual capacity helps to get into academia, and if you struggle severely with an IQ test, it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems, too. But once you are in, a superior IQ will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure.
- Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play. ¬†1 ¬†Everything You Need to Know Until now, writing and note-taking techniques were usually taught without much regard to the overarching workflow. This book aims to change that. It will present you with the tools of note-taking that turned the son of a brewer into one of the most productive and revered social scientists of the 20th century. But moreover, it describes how he implemented them into his

- Still, we often struggle the most with procrastination and motivation.

It is certainly not the lack of interesting topics, but rather the employment of problematic work routines that seems to take charge of us instead of allowing us to steer the process in the right direction. A good, structured workflow puts us back in charge and increases our freedom to do the right thing at the right time.
- This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement
- In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999).
- insight doesn‚Äôt come easy and that writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing.
- David Allen‚Äôs ‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Äù (Allen, 2001).
- We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. But first, let me guide you through the process of writing a paper with the slip-box.
- Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is.
- If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. Thinking takes place as much on paper as in your own head. ‚ÄúNotes

- Thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas is the main work of everyone who studies, does research or writes.
- these activities, you have a strong tailwind
- 1. Make fleeting notes.
- 2. Make literature notes.
- 3. Make permanent notes.
- The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?
- 4. Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box by:
- 5. Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system.
- 6. After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about.
- 7. Turn your notes into a rough draft.
- 8. Edit and proofread your manuscript.
- 5 ¬†Writing Is the Only Thing That Matters
- There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. There is no such thing
- There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. There is no such thing as a history of unwritten ideas.
- 6 ¬†Simplicity Is Paramount
- 7 ¬†Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch
- the rough order is always the same: Make a decision on what to write about, plan your research, do your research, write.
- You may remember from school the difference between an exergonic and an endergonic reaction. In the first case, you constantly need to add energy to keep the process going. In the second case, the reaction, once triggered, continues by itself and even releases energy. The dynamics of work are not so different. Sometimes we feel like our work is draining our energy and we can only move forward if we put more and more energy into it. But sometimes it is the opposite. Once we get into the workflow, it is as if the work itself gains momentum, pulling us along and sometimes even energizing us.

- 9 ¬†Separate and Interlocking Tasks ¬†9.1 ¬†¬†¬†¬† Give Each Task Your Undivided Attention
- 9.2 ¬†¬†¬†¬† Multitasking is not a good idea
- While those who multitasked felt more productive, their productivity actually decreased ‚Äì a lot (Wang and Tchernev 2012; Rosen 2008; Ophir, Nass, and Wagner 2009).
- Writing a paper involves much more than just typing on the keyboard. It also means reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting and rewriting.
- Writing a paper involves much more than just typing on the keyboard. It also means reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting and rewriting. All these are not just different tasks, but tasks requiring a different kind of attention. It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time.
- 9.3 ¬†¬†¬†¬† Give Each Task the Right Kind of Attention
- If we proofread a manuscript and don‚Äôt manage to get enough distance from ourselves as authors, we will only see our thoughts, not the actual text.
- The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.‚Äù (Dean, 2013, 152)
- 9.4 ¬†¬†¬†¬† Become an Expert Instead of a Planner
- The workflow around the slip-box is not a prescription that tells you what to do at what stage of writing. On the contrary: It gives you a structure of clearly separable tasks, which can be completed within reasonable time and provides you with instant feedback through interconnected writing tasks.
- 9.5 ¬†¬†¬†¬† Get Closure
- Attention is not our only limited resource. Our short-term memory is also limited. We need strategies not to waste its capacity with thoughts we can better delegate to an external system. While the estimations of our long-term memory capacity are wildly diverse and rather speculative, psychologists used to tend to agree on a very specific number when it came to short-term memory: We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two (Miller 1956).
- It is not that we have to choose to focus either on learning or understanding. It is always about understanding ‚Äì
- Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory ‚Äì until they are done. That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance.
- 9.6 ¬†¬†¬†¬† Reduce the Number of Decisions
- Next to the attention that can only be directed at one thing at a time and the short-term memory that can only hold up to seven things at once, the third limited resource is motivation or willpower.
- willpower is compared to muscles: a limited resource that depletes quickly and needs time to recover. Improvement through training is possible to a certain degree, but takes time and effort.

## Kafka on the Shore (Haruki Murakami; J. Philip Gabriel)
- place, but made sure the family business did
- I‚Äôm free, I think. I shut my eyes and think hard and deep about how free I am, but I can‚Äôt really understand what it means. All I know is I‚Äôm totally alone. All alone in an unfamiliar place, like some solitary explorer who‚Äôs lost his compass and his map. Is this what it means to be free? I don‚Äôt know, and I give up thinking about it.
- Free?
- In a hundred years everybody here‚Äîme included‚Äîwill have disappeared from the face of the earth and turned into ashes or dust.
- Slowly, like a movie fadeout, the real world evaporates. I‚Äôm alone, inside the world of the story. My favorite feeling in the world.

But still, no matter how much time passes, no matter what takes place in the interim, there are some things we can never assign to oblivion, memories we can never rub away. They remain with us forever, like a touchstone. And

There‚Äôs a void inside me, a blank that‚Äôs slowly expanding, devouring what‚Äôs left of who I am. I can hear it happening. I‚Äôm totally lost, my identity dying. There‚Äôs no direction where I am, no sky, no ground.

- ‚ÄúThat people‚Äôs memories are maybe the fuel they burn to stay alive. Whether those memories have any actual importance or not, it doesn‚Äôt matter as far as the maintenance of life is concerned. They‚Äôre all just fuel. Advertising fillers in the newspaper, philosophy books, dirty pictures in a magazine, a bundle of ten-thousand-yen bills: when you feed ‚Äôem to the fire, they‚Äôre all just paper. The fire isn‚Äôt thinking, ‚ÄòOh, this is Kant,‚Äô or ‚ÄòOh, this is the Yomiuri evening edition,‚Äô or ‚ÄòNice tits,‚Äô while it burns. To the fire, they‚Äôre nothing but scraps of paper. It‚Äôs the exact same thing. Important memories, not-so-important memories, totally useless memories: there‚Äôs no distinction‚Äîthey‚Äôre all just fuel.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not as if our lives are divided simply into light and dark. There‚Äôs a shadowy middle ground. Recognizing and understanding the shadows is what a healthy intelligence does. And to acquire a healthy intelligence takes a certain amount of time and effort. I don‚Äôt think you have a particularly dark character.‚Äù

- The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one‚Äôs negative experience is itself a positive experience.
- whom you caught wearing your pantyhose
- this pain, as much as we hate it, is useful. Pain is what teaches us what to pay attention to when we‚Äôre young or careless. It helps show us what‚Äôs good for us versus what‚Äôs bad for us. It helps us understand and adhere to our own limitations.
- And like our physical pain, our psychological pain is not necessarily always bad or even undesirable. In some cases, experiencing emotional or psychological pain can be healthy or necessary. Just like stubbing our toe teaches us to walk into fewer tables, the emotional pain of rejection or failure teaches us how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

- it is not time that changes man, nor knowledge; the only thing that can change someone‚Äôs mind is love.
- But there was the other side of the coin, the second thing that could make a human being take a totally different course from the one he or she had planned; and that was called despair. Yes, perhaps love really could transform someone, but despair did the job more quickly.

- I‚Äôm just walking around here between the lines, underneath the light of your eyes, in the breath of your mouth like in some beautiful happy day, which stays beautiful and happy even if my head is sick, tired, and if I have to leave Monday via Munich.

I can‚Äôt think of anything to write, I‚Äôm just walking around here between the lines, underneath the light of your eyes, in the breath of your mouth like in some beautiful happy day, which stays beautiful and happy even if my head is sick, tired, and if I have to leave Monday via Munich.

- Satisfaction The second Highlight strategy is to think about satisfaction: At the end of the day, which Highlight will bring me the most satisfaction? Whereas
- Joy The third strategy focuses on joy: When I reflect on today, what will bring me the most joy?
- satisfying Highlight is best for today.2 A good rule of thumb is to choose a Highlight that takes sixty to ninety minutes.

## How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking ‚Äì for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers (S√∂nke Ahrens)
- there is no measurable correlation between a high IQ and academic success ‚Äì at least not north of 120. Yes, a certain intellectual capacity helps to get into academia, and if you struggle severely with an IQ test, it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems, too. But once you are in, a superior IQ will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure.
- Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play. ¬†1 ¬†Everything You Need to Know Until now, writing and note-taking techniques were usually taught without much regard to the overarching workflow. This book aims to change that. It will present you with the tools of note-taking that turned the son of a brewer into one of the most productive and revered social scientists of the 20th century. But moreover, it describes how he implemented them into his

It is certainly not the lack of interesting topics, but rather the employment of problematic work routines that seems to take charge of us instead of allowing us to steer the process in the right direction. A good, structured workflow puts us back in charge and increases our freedom to do the right thing at the right time.
- This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement
- In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999).
- insight doesn‚Äôt come easy and that writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing.

- We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. But first, let me guide you through the process of writing a paper with the slip-box.
- Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is.
- If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. Thinking takes place as much on paper as in your own head. ‚ÄúNotes

- Thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas is the main work of everyone who studies, does research or writes.
- these activities, you have a strong tailwind
- 1. Make fleeting notes.
- 2. Make literature notes.
- 3. Make permanent notes.
- The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?
- 4. Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box by:
- 5. Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system.
- 6. After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about.
- 7. Turn your notes into a rough draft.
- 8. Edit and proofread your manuscript.
- 5 ¬†Writing Is the Only Thing That Matters
- There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. There is no such thing
- There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. There is no such thing as a history of unwritten ideas.
- 6 ¬†Simplicity Is Paramount
- 7 ¬†Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch
- the rough order is always the same: Make a decision on what to write about, plan your research, do your research, write.
- You may remember from school the difference between an exergonic and an endergonic reaction. In the first case, you constantly need to add energy to keep the process going. In the second case, the reaction, once triggered, continues by itself and even releases energy. The dynamics of work are not so different. Sometimes we feel like our work is draining our energy and we can only move forward if we put more and more energy into it. But sometimes it is the opposite. Once we get into the workflow, it is as if the work itself gains momentum, pulling us along and sometimes even energizing us.

- 9 ¬†Separate and Interlocking Tasks ¬†9.1 ¬†¬†¬†¬† Give Each Task Your Undivided Attention
- 9.2 ¬†¬†¬†¬† Multitasking is not a good idea
- While those who multitasked felt more productive, their productivity actually decreased ‚Äì a lot (Wang and Tchernev 2012; Rosen 2008; Ophir, Nass, and Wagner 2009).
- Writing a paper involves much more than just typing on the keyboard. It also means reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting and rewriting.
- Writing a paper involves much more than just typing on the keyboard. It also means reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting and rewriting. All these are not just different tasks, but tasks requiring a different kind of attention. It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time.
- 9.3 ¬†¬†¬†¬† Give Each Task the Right Kind of Attention
- If we proofread a manuscript and don‚Äôt manage to get enough distance from ourselves as authors, we will only see our thoughts, not the actual text.
- The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.‚Äù (Dean, 2013, 152)
- 9.4 ¬†¬†¬†¬† Become an Expert Instead of a Planner
- The workflow around the slip-box is not a prescription that tells you what to do at what stage of writing. On the contrary: It gives you a structure of clearly separable tasks, which can be completed within reasonable time and provides you with instant feedback through interconnected writing tasks.
- 9.5 ¬†¬†¬†¬† Get Closure
- Attention is not our only limited resource. Our short-term memory is also limited. We need strategies not to waste its capacity with thoughts we can better delegate to an external system. While the estimations of our long-term memory capacity are wildly diverse and rather speculative, psychologists used to tend to agree on a very specific number when it came to short-term memory: We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two (Miller 1956).
- It is not that we have to choose to focus either on learning or understanding. It is always about understanding ‚Äì
- Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory ‚Äì until they are done. That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance.
- 9.6 ¬†¬†¬†¬† Reduce the Number of Decisions
- Next to the attention that can only be directed at one thing at a time and the short-term memory that can only hold up to seven things at once, the third limited resource is motivation or willpower.
- willpower is compared to muscles: a limited resource that depletes quickly and needs time to recover. Improvement through training is possible to a certain degree, but takes time and effort.
